Release 1.2.2 - November 6, 2010
This release adds a template edit dialog and fixes some bugs.

Bugs fixed:
- Type indicator of attachments in the attachment tab of edit dialogs was
  missing. (SF#3087177)
- After editing the subject of a composite task in the task list viewer (e.g.
  changing 'Project A' into 'Project B'), also update the subjects of the
  subtasks (e.g. 'Project A -> Task 1' should update to 'Project B -> Task
  1').
- When editing a subject of a subtask in the task list viewer inline, don't
  include the subjects of its ancestors in the text control.
- When filtering on categories, don't show tasks whose subtasks (that belong
  to the filtered categories) are all hidden by another filter.
- When double clicking in the calendar viewer (when it is in vertical month
  mode) to create a new task, set the due date of the new task to the end of
  the day. This makes sure the new task is visible in the calendar after
  closing the task edit dialog. (SF#3103011)
- Include end of work day as option when selecting a time in the effort edit
  dialog. (http://uservoice.com/a/380R8)
- Remember column widths in the category viewer across sessions.

Features added:
- Don't ask for a name when creating a new template. There is now a template
  edit dialog; one can only delete templates though.
  (http://uservoice.com/a/4Ntz6)
- Allow the user to change the ordering of templates

Distribution changed:
- Added support for Fedora 14. (SF#3101814)


Release 1.2.1 - October 16, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Don't refuse to open a task file when it is sorted on a "total" column.
  (SF#3085056)
- Don't expand tasks in the prerequisite tab when opening a task dialog, it's
  really slow. (SF#3085358)
- Always display the month name in the horizontal monthly calendar view.
  (SF#3062505)
- Allow the user to resize columns in horizontal calendar view (SF#3062505)
- Reset percentage complete when recurring a task.
- When using relative paths for attachments, attachments couldn't be opened
  from the attachments tab in the edit dialog. (SF#3087177)


Release 1.2.0 - October 9, 2010
This release adds task dependencies.

Bugs fixed:
- An exception would be thrown if search strings contained a percentage
  symbol.
- When printing, correctly align columns.
- Show sort indicator in attachment viewers.
- Task Coach would always change budget, hourly fee, and fixed fee to zero
  when mass editing tasks. (SF#3081666)
- Better contrast in the calendar view (SF#3072138)
- Tasks started at 00:00 would be displayed twice in the monthly vertical
  calendar view (SF#3062501)

Feature added:
- Tasks can have one or more prerequisite tasks. As long as a task has one or
  more prerequisite tasks that are not completed, the dependent task is
  inactive. The task tree viewer has two extra columns, one for showing
  prerequisite tasks and one for showing dependent tasks. Prerequisite tasks
  can be selected in the Prerequisites tab of the task edit dialog. Dependent
  tasks cannot be selected explicitly but are simply derived from the
  prerequisite tasks. For example, if task B can be started only after task A
  has been completed, task A is called a prerequisite for task B and task B
  is called a dependency of task A.

Features changed:
- To simplify the application and reduce the number of columns all "total"
  and "overall" columns have been removed. For composite items that have
  children, the tree viewers show the "total" or "overall" value when the
  item is collapsed and the individual value when the item is not collapsed.
  An example may help: suppose task A has a budget of 20 hours and subtask A1
  has a budget of 10 hours. In the task viewer in tree mode, the budget
  column shows 20 hours for task A when it is expanded and 30 hours when it
  is collapsed. For task A1 the budget shown is always 10 hour. In list mode,
  the task viewer shows the individual values, so a budget of 20 hours for
  task A and 10 hours for task A1.
- The order of tabs in tabbed dialogs can be changed. Task Coach now
  remembers the order of the tabs in the item edit dialogs and the
  preferences dialog. (http://uservoice.com/a/oa7jx)
- When printing, show the sorted column by underlining the column header.
- Reorganized some menu items differently and added mnemonics to all menu
  items.

Implementation changed:
- The task file format was changed to support task dependencies. The task
  file format version number is now 31.


Release 1.1.4 - September 30, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Task Coach would not properly use the system's locale to select the language
  if the language was set to 'Let the system determine the language',
  resulting in the wrong language being used. (SF#3064566)
- Don't switch top/bottom and left/right margins in the print preview.
- Refresh task viewer filters every minute so that when the task viewer is
  hiding inactive tasks, inactive tasks that become active also become
  visible. (SF#3072013)
- Displaying revenue in effort viewers was slow. The effort viewer has a
  revenue column that shows the revenue earned per effort record. Until now,
  this would be the task fee per hour times the duration of the effort record
  plus the part of the fixed fee of the task earned with this effort record.
  So if a task had a fixed fee of 1000,- and you had spent 10 hours on the
  task, an effort record of one hour would have a revenue of 100,-. However,
  calculating all this would get slow for larger amounts of effort records,
  so the effort revenue now only shows the variable part, i.e. fee per hour
  times effort duration. (SF#3056540)
- In the situation where Task Coach was started minimized in the system tray
  and with the setting "Hide window when minimizing" turned on, the main
  window would not be hidden when minimizing it. (SF#3077271)

Features added:
- Allow hiding composite tasks in calendar view.
  (http://uservoice.com/a/aul3S)
- In the tree/list task viewer, allow additional selection with Cmd-click on
  Mac OS X.


Release 1.1.3 - September 10, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- When closing a edit dialog, don't delete the category, note, and attachment
  viewers in the dialog before the data has been processed. (SF#3059143)
- The PortableApps platform would override the language selected by the user
  in Task Coach. (SF#2965342, SF#3059429)
- When retrieving the latest available Task Coach version number from the Task
  Coach website doesn't work, simply ignore that.
- Don't crash when searching efforts with "Include subitems" turned on.

Feature added:
- When selecting the language in the preferences dialog, you can select 'Let
  the system determine the language'. If you're using the PortableApps
  version of Task Coach and the PortableApps platform, the PortableApps
  platform language will be used. Otherwise, Task Coach will let your system's
  locale determine the language.


Release 1.1.2 - September 2, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Task Coach wouldn't run on Ubuntu 9.04. This is because Task Coach tried to
  use a feature from wxPython 2.8.9.2 while Ubuntu 9.04 ships with wxPython
  2.8.9.1. (SF#3054431)
- Only close edit dialogs when the edited item is really deleted, not when the
  item is hidden by a filter. (SF#3042880)
- Refresh filtered task viewers at midnight to properly show tasks that
  become active. (SF#3035384)
- The checkbox for mutual exclusive subcategories in the category editor
  would be unchecked even if a category had exclusive subcategories.


Release 1.1.1 - August 26, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- On Mac OS X, properly read task files when the font description cannot be
  parsed. This may happen when reading a task file that was last saved on a
  different platform. Unfortunately, font specifications are platform
  specific. (SF#3047183)
- Prevent exception when reading old task files.
- Saving of templates didn't work, resulting in invalid template files that
  would in turn prevent Task Coach from starting properly. (SF#3052090)
- On Windows, the tabs of the dialogs would flicker when moving the mouse over
  the tabs.
- Use dialogs for reminders. (SF#3050445)


Release 1.1.0 - August 20, 2010
This release adds time to start, due and completion dates of tasks and adds
support for mass editing of items. It also adds support for the upcoming
version 3.0 for the iPhone/iPod/iPad.

Bugs fixed:
- Icons in edit dialogs would be lined up vertically on some versions of
  Windows XP. Fixed by using a notebook widget instead of the listbook widget.
  (SF#2927384)
- The new edit dialogs better support tabbing through the dialogs.
  (SF#2687959)
- On Mac OS X, the tabs in the editor and preferences dialogs were too small.
- Searching descriptions wasn't working in the effort viewer. (SF#3031411)

Features added:
- The start, due and completion dates of tasks now also include a time. When
  reading old task files, Task Coach adds a default time to tasks: start
  dates get a time of "00:00", due dates and completion dates get a time of
  "23:59". (http://uservoice.com/a/nd3mH)
- Mass editing of items. When editing multiple items (tasks, notes, etc.),
  the edit dialog allows for selectively changing attributes of all edited
  items. (http://uservoice.com/a/ahxq8)
- Less intrusive notifications (reminders).
- The calendar orientation can be changed.
- Add an option to the calendar viewer to show all tasks but those which have
  no start nor due date (SF#3008517)
- The headers in the calendar view are now always visible.
  (http://uservoice.com/a/irtQs)
- The calendar view can show an arbitrary number of periods (except months).
  (http://uservoice.com/a/5F5Ka)

Implementation changed:
- The task file format was changed to support start, due and completion date
  and time. The task file format version number is now 30.


Release 1.0.10 - August 15, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- When SyncML was on, the effort viewer would show effort for deleted tasks.
- When dragging panes and dropping them onto each other to create an automatic
  notebook, make sure dropped viewers are properly contained in the notebook.
- When renaming a viewer, apply the new name to the active viewer.
  (SF#3042037)

Feature added:
- Allow automatic creation of a notebook of viewers on top of the initial task
  viewer. This makes the user interface functionally equivalent to the
  previously removed "tabbed" mode.


Release 1.0.9 - August 8, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- On Windows, Task Coach wouldn't start when the user interface was in
  "tabbed" mode. (SF#3041123)
- On Windows, toolbar items that should trigger a popup menu (e.g. templates)
  wouldn't.
- On Windows, disabled toolbar buttons wouldn't be greyed out.

Feature removed:
- The "tabbed" user interface mode has been removed. Having two different
  user interfaces makes it harder to test changes that affect the user
  interface, as evidenced by a bug in the previous release.


Release 1.0.8 - August 6, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Drop support for SyncML on Debian; too many architectures/versions to
  support.

- Refresh filter for tasks due today/tomorrow/etc. at midnight. (SF#3035384)
- On Linux, when selecting an effort in the effort viewer with the mouse also
  give keyboard focus to the effort viewer. (SF#3039519)


Release 1.0.7 - July 2, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:

  (SF#2992853, SF#2992850, SF#2992848)
- On Mac OS X, don't cut text in text controls when the user types
  <cmd><shift>X, only when she types <cmd>X. (SF#2942288)

  characters. (SF#3014110)
- Correctly export tasks and effort to vCalendar (.ics) when they contain non-
  ascii characters. (SF#3016528)


Release 1.0.5 - June 8, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Task Coach would fail to save the task file correctly, when it couldn't
  read temporary files for email attachments. (SF#2369711)
- Don't crash when using a purple folder or led icon. (SF#3009432)
- Don't allow exporting efforts to iCalendar when effort viewer is in
  aggregate mode, it would result in an empty .ics file. (SF#2935616)
- SyncML synchronization did not work for tasks. (SF#3012234)

Feature changed:
- Renamed the Edit->Paste into task menu item to Edit->Paste as subitem and

Bugs fixed:
- When starting iconized on Mac OS X, the application window would close.
  (SF#2992764)
- When exporting tasks with descriptions that contain newlines to iCalendar
  (.ics) format, produce a valid iCalendar file. (SF#2975805)

  effort viewer would still show some of the removed efforts.
- When waking up from standby/sleep, only request user attention when there

- The synchronization with the iPhone would crash in some circumstances, when
  parent objects have been used on the iPhone and are deleted on the desktop.
  (SF#3007248)
- When maximizing or minimizing priority, don't take the priority of deleted
  tasks into account. (SF#3008495)
- When calculating overall percentage complete of a task, consider whether the
  task will be completed automatically when all of its subtasks are completed.
  (SF#2992534)

Feature changed:
- Added some more possible snooze times. Use the preferences dialog to turn
  them on.

Distributions changed:

  items the user is/was working on. (http://uservoice.com/a/9zBuo)
- In the task, category, and note viewers, show long descriptions in a text
  control with scrollbars so the rows don't take up too much vertical space.
  (http://uservoice.com/a/h37jH)
- Tasks can now be sorted in the calendar viewer.
- Support for libnotify under Linux (for reminders).


Release 1.0.2 - April 10, 2010
This release fixes some bugs, and adds support for the Snarl notification
system.

Bugs fixed:
- Exports and prints would show long descriptions abbreviated with "...",
  exactly as the long descriptions were displayed in the description column
  of task, category, and note tree viewers. To fix this, the task, category,
  and note tree viewers show descriptions fully (when the description column
  is visible). (SF#2975805)
- In the calendar viewer, March 31st would not appear. (SF#2979461)
- The 13th hour would not show up in thr daily calendar view. (SF#2979452)
- The position of the main window wouldn't be saved so it couldn't be restored
  the next session. (SF#2969292)

- After double clicking a task in the calendar viewer and changing its dates,
  if the change would make the task disappear from the current period, the
  task would not be properly drawn.

Feature added:
- Support for Snarl under Windows (for reminders).


Release 1.0.1 - March 26, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:

Release 1.0.0 - March 22, 2010
To mark that Task Coach has been available for five years now, we call this
release version 1.0. This release adds a calendar viewer for tasks, partial

Release 0.78.3 - January 31, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Free up resources (user objects and memory) on Windows when closing dialogs.
  The memory leak was caused by popup menu's in dialogs not being deleted.
  (SF#2938091, SF#2891350, SF#2560895, SF#2444185, SF#2214043)
- Close the inline subject edit control before showing or hiding columns in
  tree viewers, to prevent problems redrawing the tree items. (SF#2940211)

  that color with the foreground colors of the task's categories. (SF#2930751)
- Let subtasks use their parent's category-based foreground color when they
  don't have their own foreground color. (SF#2930751)
- When there are a lot of old backup files don't clean them up all at once,
  but instead a few on each save. (SF#2929692, SF#2929475)


Release 0.78.0 - January 10, 2010
This release adds configurable fonts and foreground colors, enhances the
reminder dialog, makes other small changes and fixes some bugs.

Bugs fixed:
- Make file locking work on Windows computers that have a hostname with non-
  ASCII characters in it. (SF#2904864)
- Avoid deploying UxTheme.dll because it causes problems on 64-bits Windows
  systems. (SF#2911280, SF#2897639, SF#2886396)
- Correctly refresh task square map and task time line viewers after stopping
  effort tracking, i.e. stop showing the clock icon on the previously tracked
  task.
- When maximizing and restoring panes (viewers), don't change the order.
  (SF#2922952)
- Slightly faster redrawing of task viewers after sorting or filtering.
- In some circumstances, synchronization with an iPhone/iPod Touch device
  would crash the app. (SF#2925618)

Features added:
- Tasks, categories, notes and attachment can have their own font. Tasks,
  notes and attachments that don't have their own font use the font of the
  categories they belong to. Effort records use the font of the task they
  belong to.
- In addition to the background color, the foreground (text) color of tasks,
  categories, notes and attachments can now also be changed. Tasks, notes and
  attachments that don't have their own foreground color use the foreground
  color of the categories they belong to. Effort records use the foreground
  color of the task they belong to.
- Added Ctrl+E keyboard shortcut to "New effort..." menu item.
- Reminder dialogs have an extra button to mark the task completed.
  (http://uservoice.com/a/5HVq3)
- The snooze times offered by the reminder dialog can be configured via the
  preferences dialog.

Features changed:
- Task Coach now limits the number of backups made of a task file. The number
  of backups retained increases logarithmically with the age of the oldest
  backup of the task file. When Task Coach needs to remove a backup it tries
  to keep the remaining backups spread evenly across time.
  (http://uservoice.com/a/5FrtF)
- Merged the four menu items for exporting tasks and effort to iCalendar and
  vCalendar formats into two menu items.


Release 0.77.0 - December 6, 2009
This release adds mutually exclusive categories and fixes some bugs.

Bugs fixed:
- Only the first reminder defined in a session would be fired. (SF#2901254)
- Don't start in-line editing of subjects when an item is double clicked.
  Properly close the subject edit text control, e.g. when sort order is
  changed. (SF#2896654, SF#2899913)
- Don't open effort viewer contex (right-click) menu twice on every right-
  click. (SF#2902389)

Features added:
- Categories can have mutually exclusive subcategories. This makes it easier
  to e.g. create your own statuses or to keep track of which task was assigned
  to whom. (http://uservoice.com/a/tvOIS)
- F2 can be used to start in-line editing of the subject of a task, category
  or note. (http://uservoice.com/a/9pLUT)
- Added partial Mongolian translation.


Release 0.76.1 - November 13, 2009
This release adds Growl support on Mac OS X, and fixes some bugs.

Bugs fixed:
- The notes and attachment columns were not properly refreshed after removing
  the last note or attachment. (SF#2894530)
- Reminders would randomly not work. (SF#2888688)
- Recurrence frequency would be reset to zero when edited. (SF#2895085)
- Instead of the whole description, show only the first few lines of
  descriptions in the description column of task, note, and category viewers.

Features added:
- On Mac OS X, you can optionally choose to use Growl for reminders. When
  enabled, this disables two other features: snooze/don't snooze and open task
  on reminder.
- Added back the possibility to hide active tasks so that people can have a
  task viewer that only displays completed tasks.
  (http://uservoice.com/a/NQCUV)


Release 0.76.0 - November 7, 2009
This release adds buttons on the toolbar of task viewers to hide completed
and/or future tasks, makes subjects editable in-line, removes a couple of
silly features, and fixes some bugs.

Bugs fixed:
- Iterating over viewers wasn't working in tabbed mode.
- When merging a task file with categories, don't break the links between
  tasks/notes and categories. (SF#2882493)
- Tree viewers wouldn't properly refresh when an attribute of a task,
  category, or note was changed to be empty. (SF#2806354)
- When tracking effort, effort viewers in aggregated mode (showing effort per
  day/week/month) were not being updated every second.
- Tabs in the tabbed window layout could not be closed.
- Don't complain when the system locale has a thousands separator that
  consists of more than one character. (SF#2889931, SF#2888714)

Features added:

Features removed:
- Don't have a setting for the maximum number of recent files to show, simply

Release 0.75.0 - October 24, 2009
This release adds percentage complete tracking for tasks, a PortableApps
version of Task Coach and some minor features and bug fixes.

Bugs fixed:
- Make opening (task) edit dialogs faster. (SF#2884522)
- Use 'now' as default time in effort dialogs on Mac OS X instead of
  '0:00:00'. (SF#2874824)

Features added:
- Tasks have a percentage complete property. (http://uservoice.com/a/Icogx)
- Double clicking the task bar icon will iconize the main window when it is
  visible and restore it when iconized (Mac OS X and Windows).
  (http://uservoice.com/a/dKfBt)
- When browsing for an attachment, start in the current attachment directory.
- Under Windows, prevent users from deleting temporary files and thus loosing
  all their e-mail attachments.

  distributions.


Release 0.74.4 - October 17, 2009
This is a bugfix release that fixes some user interface bugs, most notably
that entering dates with the keyboard was not working on Mac OS X and Linux.

Bugs fixed:
- Typing in time controls (effort start and stop, reminder) didn't work on Mac
  OS X. (SF#2798239)
- Prevent the locked file dialog and the new version notification dialog of
  blocking each other on Mac OS X.
- When using the context menu of a selected effort record to create a new
  effort record use the task of the selected effort record as task of the new
  effort record as well. (SF#2873933)
- After expanding all items (Shift+Ctrl+E), keep items expanded even when sort
  order changes or tasks are completed. (SF#2841854)
- The "Open all attachments" menu item was always disabled. (SF#2874180)

- On Linux and Mac OS X, changing dates by typing a new date (i.e. not using

Release 0.74.3 - October 4, 2009
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Exporting and printing, including displaying the print preview, is now much

- Task Coach wouldn't start when using the tabbed main window mode on Mac OS
  X. (SF#2867585)


Release 0.74.2 - September 25, 2009
This is a bugfix release that fixes several minor bugs and increases
performance.

Bugs fixed:
- iPhone synchronization: when doing a full refresh from desktop, categories
  parents could be mismatched.
- A bug in the task filter would cause tasks to be shown that were supposed to
  be hidden. (SF#2841854)
- The filter submenu would sometimes be in the wrong state (enabled or
  disabled).
- On Linux, locking two task files in the same folder, e.g. when merging,
  would make Task Coach think that its task file was locked by another
  instance of Task Coach. (SF#2852216)
- Performance improvements. Task Coach still isn't super fast, but at least
  performance should be a bit better now. (SF#2807678, SF#2683002)

Features added:
- Add an option to avoid uploading completed tasks to the iPhone/iPod Touch
  when synchronizing. For people who hide completed tasks, this can make the
  synchronization much quicker.
- Under MS Windows, the task template directory may now be a shortcut to
  another directory.
- In the attachment viewer, display a red icon for files attachments when the
  file does not exist. Also prevent the user from trying to open it.

  and not very useful.

This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Printing didn't work. (SF#2840010)

  default profile.


Release 0.74.0 - August 16, 2009
This release adds better HTML export, a winPenPack version of Task Coach, and
fixes some bugs. Task Coach now uses Uservoice.com for feature requests.

Bugs fixed:
- Avoid nested syncml tags in the XML task file (SF#2832062, SF#2813816)

- Translate tip window and search controls on Windows. (SF#2825463)

Features added:
- When exporting data to an HTML file, Task Coach writes a simple CSS
  stylesheet alongside it. The CSS stylesheet can be edited by the user using
  a text editor; Task Coach won't overwrite it.

  considered 'soon' can now be set via the preferences dialog, in the task
  behavior tab. (SF#1312000)

Distribution changed:

  of available distributions.

Website change:
- We're now using http://taskcoach.uservoice.com for feature requests. The
  big advantage of Uservoice over the Sourceforge feature request tracker is
  that Uservoice allows for voting. Because we have over 250 open feature
  requests on Sourceforge, it is not possible for us to move all feature
  requests ourselves. People that submitted a feature request on Sourceforge
  will receive a notification and a request to help us move their request(s)
  to Uservoice. (index.html)


Release 0.73.4 - August 6, 2009

  context menu. (SF#2830125)

  preference dialog or specified on the command line. (SF#2831534)


Release 0.73.3 - August 2, 2009
This release fixes some bugs, and adds support for synchronizing with the next

- Load a .po file (a file containing translations) with a command line
  option. Type "taskcoach[.py|.exe] --help" on the command line for more
  information. This option allows translators to check their work more
  easily. (SF#1599933)

Bugs fixed:
- When opening a task edit dialog, the priority field would not show the
  priority until the up or down button was clicked (Mac OS X only).
- When opening a locked file, Task Coach would hang (Mac OS X only).
- Require wxPython 2.8.9.1 instead of 2.8.9.2 in the Debian package file
  (.deb) because Ubuntu 9.04 is still shipping 2.8.9.1 (Ubuntu only).

- Fix drag and drop from Outlook (Windows only). (SF#2803013)
- When logging off or shutting down the computer save unsaved changes (Linux

Features added:
- All export options can now also export selected items only.

- The effort background is now colored with the same color as the task it
  belongs to.
- The effort viewer can show the (overall) categories of the task of each
  effort in an (overall) categories column. Patch provided by Thomas Sonne
  Olesen. (SF#1911052, SF#1791670)
- When the effort viewer is in weekly mode, it can show effort per weekday.
  Patch provided by Thomas Sonne Olesen.
- The automatic resizing of columns can be turned off on a viewer by viewer
  basis, using the 'Automatic column resizing' checkable menu item in the
  View->Columns menu and/or in the column header right-click menu.
  (SF#2047851, SF#1466164)
- The expansion state of tasks, categories and notes is saved in the task
  file. (SF#2045453, SF#1790057)
- Added Catalan translation thanks to Ferran Roig, Jordi Mallach, Josep-Miquel
  Ivars, and devaleitzer.
- Added an (incomplete) Arabic translation thanks to Moayyed. Please help
  finish it. See http://www.taskcoach.org/i18n.html.
- Added largely incomplete Esperanto, Estonian, Indonesian, Marathi,
  Lithuanian, Norwegion Nynorsk, Slovenian, Telugu, and Vietnamese
  translations. Please help finish them. See
  http://www.taskcoach.org/i18n.html.

Implementation changed:
- The task file format (version 20) was changed. Task nodes may have a
  recurrence node that contains the recurrence state of the task. Categories
  and notes can contain attachments. Tasks and categories can now contain
  notes.


Release 0.70.4 - September 28, 2008
Bug fix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Allow Task Coach to be installed on Ubuntu 7.10. (SF#2117477)
- Task Coach wasn't notifying users of new versions.
- When merging, merge notes too.
- When the notes feature is turned off, hide the 'Create new note' menu item
  in the category pop up menu.
- Fixed a translation bug. (SF#2087395)
- Hide/show the main window with one click on the task bar icon instead of a
  double click (Linux only).
- The Task Coach main window would get a very small size if it was started
  minimized and had not been restored in the previous session. (SF#2052910)


Release 0.70.3 - August 17, 2008
Bug fix release.

Bugs fixed:
- wxPython 2.8.8.1 generates images in a new, backwards incompatible way,
  even when told not to do that. This bug affects users that have an older
  version of wxPython installed and use one of the Linux packages. Fixed by
  adding the relevant pieces from wxPython 2.8.8.1 to the Task Coach sources.
  (SF#2046084)
- Opening a new task viewer didn't work. (SF#2053008)
- Closing effort viewers causes exceptions. (SF#2053008)


Release 0.70.2 - August 6, 2008
This release fixes some bugs and brings back the Fedora RPM.

Bugs fixed:
- Using the "Save selection" feature together with mail attachments could
  result in data loss.
- Under KDE, the maximized state of the main window would not be restored.
- One couldn't e-mail tasks with non-ASCII characters in their description.
  (SF#2025676)
- Dragging an email message from Thunderbird and dropping it on Task Coach
  could give a "UnicodeDecodeError" on Fedora. (SF#1953166)
- When an invalid regular expression was entered in a search control, no items
  were displayed. Additionally, if it was saved in TaskCoach.ini, TaskCoach
  would crash on launch later.
- Mention of non-existing files in taskcoach.spec prevented the Fedora RPM
  from being built.
- The category viewer would sometimes skip keyboard navigation or need an
  extra mouse-click to get focus. (SF#2020816, SF#2020812)
- On Mac OS X, the keyboard shortcut for 'help' was interfering with the
  shortcut for 'hide window'. (SF#2006455)

Features added:
- Notes can be e-mailed.
- Display a tool tip to warn user when a search string is an invalid regular
  expression. In this case, default to substring search.
- Optionally put Task Coach in the user's startup menu so that Task Coach is
  started automatically when the user logs on (Windows only). (SF#2017400,
  SF#1913650)
- Made (right-click) context menu's more consistent.

Feature removed:
- Don't supply the dummy recipient 'Please enter recipient' to the email
  program when mailing a task. This only forces the user to perform an extra
  action to remove that dummy text, while most if not all email programs will
  warn the user when she forgets to enter a recipient. (SF#2026833)


Release 0.70.1 - June 28, 2008
This release optionally brings back the tabbed user interface that was
removed in the previous release and fixes a few bugs.

Bugs fixed:
- The search control in the toolbar did not maintain state correctly for
  different viewers. Task Coach viewers now each have their own toolbar with
  search control. (SF#1977196)
- Marking tasks completed or changing their priority would change the
  selection. (SF#1888598, SF#1926362)
- On Max OS X, put preferences menu item in the TaskCoach menu instead of the
  Edit menu to conform with Mac OS X standards. (SF#1965861)
- Focus issues: On Mac OS X, text couldn't be edited while the timer was
  running. On Windows, notifications from other programs overlapping with the
  main window would take away focus from dialogs. (SF#1995469, SF#2000152)
- Prevent crash under Windows XP when dropping e-mail from Thunderbird if the
  APPDATA environment variable is not defined. (SF#1960827)
- ImportError: No module named thirdparty.ElementTree. This exception would
  happen when using a source distribution of Task Coach or a package (rpm,
  deb) for Linux *and* when the default version of Python on the system is
  Python 2.4. Task Coach tried to import a module from the wrong package.
  (SF#1964069)
- On Linux, when using a dark theme, use appropriate background colors for
  the category viewer and the text color buttons in the preferences dialog.
  (SF#1988160)
- Remember whether the main window was maximized and if so, maximize the main
  window when starting the next time. (SF#1969266)
- Correctly sort tasks on startup when sort column is 'Overall categories'.
  (SF#1962003)
- Correctly redraw toolbar when it is 'damaged' by other windows (SF#1977208)
- Correctly sort effort for subtasks in effort per day, per week, and per
  month effort viewers. (SF#1989553)
- Better navigation with tab key in dialogs.
- Keep newlines in descriptions when printing or exporting to HTML.

Feature added:
- Task Coach can now use either the old tabbed user interface (whose layout
  still cannot be saved, by the way) or the 'managed frame' interface
  introduced in release 0.70.0. This can be changed in the Preferences dialog.
  (SF#1964213)


Release 0.70.0 - May 12, 2008
Small feature enhancements, more translations and several bug fixes. Task
Coach is now distributed under the GPLv3+.

Bugs fixed:
- Allow for editing seconds in effort editor. (SF#1925748)
- The combobox in the effort detail editor always picked the first task when
  multiple tasks had the same subject, effectively prohibiting the user to
  move an effort record to another task with the same subject. (SF#1918033)
- Reset invalid input in the priority field of the task editor to 0 instead of
  to the minimum priority (a large negative value). (SF#1949222)
- "View->Filter->Reset all filters" now also unchecks all categories.
- Task Coach now is packaged as a proper Debian package, thanks to Stani
  Michiels. The Debian package installs a menu item for Task Coach in the
  Applications/Office menu. (SF#1792706, SF#1792711, SF#1896796)

Features added:
- Paths to file attachments may be relative.
- Monthly recurrence of tasks. (SF#1933222, SF#1957687)
- Added and reorganized keyboard short cuts. (SF#1857101)
- Start tracking effort for any active task using the system tray icon right-
  click menu. (SF#1934738, SF#1739666)
- Added a largely complete Ukranian translation thanks to Vitovt and
  incomplete Finnish, Greek, Persian and Thai translations.

Feature changed:
- Slightly higher preference window so all icons fit and no scrolling is
  needed. (SF#1918678)

Dependencies changed:
- Task Coach now uses Subversion for version control. See
  http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=130831. This only affects you if you
  want to develop or use Task Coach source code.
- Task Coach is now distributed under the GNU General Public License version
  3 or (at your option) any later version. This only affects you if you want
  to distribute changed versions of Task Coach or want to include source code
  from Task Coach in other software.


Release 0.69.2 - March 28, 2008
Bug fix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Tasks created via the context menu of the category view now automatically
  belong to the selected category. (SF#1592103)
- Update task status and colors at midnight. (SF#1183043)
- Exception when starting Task Coach ("AttributeError: 'CategoryList' object
  has no attribute 'EventTypePrefix'"). (SF#1901385)
- Exception when reopening a closed viewer (with the message
  "ConfigParser.NoSectionError: No section: 'effortperdayviewer1'" in the log
  file). (SF#1894488)
- Exception when resetting all filters in the task tree viewer (with the
  message "No option 'hidecompositetasks' in section: 'tasktreelistview'" in
  the log file). (SF#1903679)
- Don't take the priority of completed subtasks into account when calculating
  the overall priority of a task. (SF#1905774)
- It was not clear that backup files can be opened in Task Coach. Backup files
  now have the extension '.tsk.bak'. The file open dialog has '*.tsk.bak' as
  selectable file type to make it easier to open backup files. (SF#1911538)
- Exception when opening the task menu while the toolbar is hidden.

Features added:
- Task Coach now suggests a reminder date, based on the due date or start date
  of a task.
- Added a complete Norwegion Bokmal translation thanks to Amund Amundsen and
  incomplete Galician, Korean and Romanian translations.


Release 0.69.1 - February 14, 2008
Bug fix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Exception when closing a task editor dialog. This causes updates of task
  states not to be displayed properly. The bug itself does not cause data
  loss, but it might trick users into saving an empty task file over their
  existing data. (SF#1893634)
- On Mac OS X, users couldn't enter 'P' and 'M' in text boxes, because these
  were mapped to menu items. Reorganized keyboard shortcuts to fix this.
  (SF#1890566)
- The arrow ('â†’') and infinity symbol ('âˆž') are not visible on
  all computers, so Task Coach is back to using '->' and 'Infinite' again.


Release 0.69.0 - February 9, 2008
This release makes it possible to repeat tasks on either a daily or a weekly
basis and to add notes to categories. It also contains a number of other
changes and bug fixes.

Bugs fixed:
- The reminder dialog didn't close when opening the task from the reminder
  dialog. If the user had entered a snooze option in the reminder dialog, that
  snooze option would be overwritten when closing the task editor.
  (SF#1862286)
- Don't allow filtering by both a parent and a child category at the same
  time.
- Sorting by total categories in the task viewers didn't sort correctly.
- Save didn't work for task files without a file name and without tasks, but
  with categories or notes.
- Adding a task to a category or removing it from a category was not undoable.

Features added:
- Tasks can recur on a daily or weekly basis. This feature is not complete
  yet. Most obviously, recurring on a monthly basis is missing. Also,
  recurring tasks with recurring subtasks do not behave entirely correctly
  yet. (SF#1623364, SF#1464793, SF#1264210)
- Notes can be assigned to categories.
- Added Bulgarian translation, thanks to Rumen Belev.
- Added Danish translation, thanks to different translators.
- Added a number of rather incomplete translations (Italian, Portuguese,
  Swedish, and Turkish). See http://www.taskcoach.org/i18n.html for how you
  can help improve these translations.
- When filtering by one or more categories, new tasks and notes are
  automatically added to those categories. Of course, you can still change the
  categories in the category tab of the edit dialog before pressing the OK
  button.
- Whether descriptions of tasks, effort records, categories and notes are
  shown in a popup tooltip window is now a setting. (SF#1857098)
- Added menu items for increasing, decreasing, maximizing, and minimizing
  task priority. (SF#1768210, SF#1570616)
- Clicking a column header in a task viewer now iterates through the following
  sort orders: 'ascending, after sorting by task status first', 'descending,
  after sorting by task status first', 'ascending, without sorting by task
  status first', 'descending, without sorting by task status first'.

Features changed:
- Previously, unset dates were displayed as 'None' in date columns. To be
  consistent with how other attributes are displayed in columns, Task Coach
  now simply displays nothing for unset dates in date columns.
- Task Coach now uses the infinity symbol ('âˆž') to display the number of
  days left for tasks without a due date, instead of the word 'Infinite'.
- Task Coach now uses a real arrow symbol ('â†’') instead of '->' for
  separating parent and child subjects in the different viewers.

Feature removed:
- Task Coach no longer keeps track of the 'last modification time' of tasks.


Release 0.68.0 - December 26, 2007
This release makes it possible to open a task from its reminder dialog, adds a
command line option to facilitate the PortableApps.com Task Coach
distribution, makes starting and stopping effort tracking quicker and fixes a
number of bugs.

Bugs fixed:
- Start and stop tracking effort is faster for tasks that have a large number
  of associated effort records.
- Task Coach now gives an error message if the file that it tries to open
  doesn't exist. (SF#1857093)
- When selecting all text in a text control with '<cmd>a', indeed select all
  text and not all tasks (Max OSX only). (SF#1857091)
- Attempt to prevent crashes on Fedora 8 that sometimes happen when adding top
  level tasks. (SF#1840111)

Features added:
- It is possible to open a task from its reminder dialog.

  the ini file is located.


Release 0.67.0 - December 16, 2007
This release make it possible to color tasks via their categories, adds a
translation in Hebrew, and makes it easier to mark tasks as not completed.

Bug fixed:
- Don't move selection to the first line of the task tree viewer when deleting
  a subtask. (SF#1849171)

Features added:
- Added Hebrew translation thanks to Ziv Barcesat.
- You can assign a color to a category. Tasks are colored according to the
  color of the categories they belong to. (SF#1466159, SF#1784932)
- The 'mark task completed' button and menu items can now also be used to
  mark tasks as not completed. (SF#1449714)

Dependency changed:
- Task Coach now needs at least wxPython 2.8.6.0-unicode. Since the Windows
  installer and the Mac OSX dmg package have wxPython included, this only
  affects users of the RPM, Debian, and source distributions.


Release 0.66.3 - December 11, 2007
Bug fix release to address crashes.

Bug fixed:
- Work around a bug in the TreeListCtrl widget that caused crashes. The

platform and several minor bugs that affect users on all platforms.

Bugs fixed:
- Don't leak GDI objects on Windows. (SF#1813632, SF#1811058, SF#1810297,
  SF#1806004, SF#1803085)

- Saving a task file after adding attachments via the 'add attachment' menu or
  context menu fails. (SF#1796829)


Release 0.65.0 - September 9, 2007
This release adds the ability to record notes, improves the flexibility of
the different views, and fixes several bugs.

Bugs fixed:
- Made subject column resizable. (SF#1702270, SF#1766664)
- Enable export of data containing non-ASCII characters to CSV. (SF#1753422)
- Don't activate another viewer when another application is minimized (Windows
  only). (SF#1765103)

  the source code distribution of Task Coach works with Python 2.4, without
  needing to install ElementTree. (SF#1783575)

Features added:
- Notes. Notes have a subject and an optional description. Notes can be
  hierarchical, i.e. notes may contain subnotes. Notes can be sorted and
  searched (filtered), printed, and exported. This feature can be turned on or
  off via the preferences dialog.

  toolbar.
- Category sorting can be changed: ascending or descending, case sensitive or
  case insensitive.
- Categories can have a description.
- Each viewer/tab has its own settings for sort order and visible columns.
  Viewers can be renamed. This makes it possible to e.g. create a 'Todo
  today'.
- The search control on the toolbar can (optionally) include subitems in the
  search result. This makes it easy to show one task and its subtasks in a
  task viewer or show effort for one task and its subtasks in an effort
  viewer.

  installed for a different python version than the one the user is starting
  Task Coach with. (SF#1728485)


Release 0.64.0 - May 28, 2007

Bugs fixed:
- Ubuntu users had to manually install the wxaddons package. This package is
  now included in the Task Coach distribution.
- Don't hide the main window when it's iconized by default because on Linux
  with some window managers the main window receives minimize events in other
  situations as well, most notably when changing virtual desktops. So, to
  reduce the chances of confusing new users this option is off by default.
  (SF#1721166)

Features added:

Release 0.63.0 - April 9, 2007

Bugs fixed:
- Cancelling printing would give a 'Task Coach Error'
- Make sure the main window is on a visible display when starting. This is
  for laptop users that sometimes extend their desktop to a second display.
  (SF#1667120)
- Sort categories alphabetically in the categories viewer. (SF#1694532)
- Filtering a category no longer automatically checks all subcategories.
  However, tasks belonging to a subcategory are still filtered (since they
  belong to the filtered category via the subcategory).

Features added:
- Export to HTML and printing of tasks colors tasks appropriately.
- Added description columns to the task and effort viewers. Like other
  columns, the description column is printed and exported if visible.
- Added reminder column to the task viewers.


Release 0.62.0 - April 1, 2007

- Whether the clock icon in the task bar blinks or not is now a setting (see
  Edit -> Preferences -> Window behavior.

  item' now work for tasks, effort records and categories, depending on what
  view is active.
- Added a category column for task viewers. (SF#1629283)
- Added an attachment column that shows whether a task has one or more
  attachments.
- Added an 'Open all attachments' menu item for tasks
- Added snooze option to reminders.

Feature changed:
- Removed filter sidebar. Filter options previously available on the sidebar
  are now available via the search filter on the toolbar, the category tab and
  the view menu.

Dependency changed:
- Task Coach now requires wxPython 2.8.3-unicode or newer (this is only
  relevant if you use the source distribution).


Release 0.61.6 - January 27, 2007

Bugs fixed:
- Crash on trying to use down-arrow to move to sub-task. (SF#1640806)

  SF#1589993)


Release 0.61.5 - January 10, 2007

Bug fixed:

- MSVCP71.DLL was missing from the Windows distribution. (SF#1602364)
- Marking a task completed while completed tasks are hidden wouldn't
  immediately hide the completed task. (SF#1572920)
- The category filter was not applied correctly on launch; showing categories
  as filtered but not hiding the associated tasks. (SF#1603846)
- Turning on filtering for a category didn't mark the task file as changed.
  (SF#1603846)

Feature added:
- Added RPM and Debian distributions.


Release 0.61.3 - November 19, 2006

Bugs fixed:
- If saving the TaskCoach.ini file would fail, displaying the error message
  would fail (too) because the i18n translator had not been imported at that
  point. (SF#1598568)
- Mac OSX distribution did not start. Upgraded py2app. (SF#1594190)
- Dragging and dropping a task in the task tree view would sometimes drag the
  wrong task.

  non-ASCII characters. (SF#1589991)
- Deleting a task would not delete the task from the categories it belonged
  to, resulting in errors upon next loading of the task file. (SF#1589993)


Release 0.61.1 - November 3, 2006

Bug fixed:
- Source distribution was missing some files.


Release 0.61.0 - November 2, 2006

Bugs fixed:
- Displaying a previously hidden toolbar would result in an incorrectly drawn
  window. (SF#1551885)
- Exported HTML didn't contain an explicit charset. (SF#1561490)
- Negative effort preventation was not working correctly. (SF#1575458)

Features added:
- Hierarchical categories.
- Export in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format. As with export to HTML, the
  current view is exported. (SF#1534862)
- Task Coach can be run from a removable medium, such as a USB stick. On
  Windows, use the installer to install Task Coach to the medium. Then, start
  Task Coach and turn the setting 'Save settings to same directory as
  program' on. This setting can be found in Edit -> Preferences -> File).
  This makes sure the TaskCoach.ini file is saved on the removable medium, in
  the same directory as the main program. (SF#1464435)


Release 0.60 - August 30, 2006

Bugs fixed:
- Closing a task file did not reset the 'lastfile' setting. (SF#1548126)
- Selecting Japanese translation would cause error upon next restart.
  (SF#1545593)
- Task Coach wouldn't quit when the setting 'Minimize window when closing' was
  set. (SF#1545936)
- Deleting an effort record would throw an exception. (SF#1548117)

Website change:
- Added MD5 digests to download page. (download.html)


Release 0.59 - August 23, 2006

Bugs fixed:
- Improved efficiency while tracking effort for tasks. (SF#1429545)
- The column width of the list with filenames in the attachment page of the
  task editor is now adaptable, so that long filenames can be made visible
  entirely. (SF#1503006)
- Translation errors in tips. (SF#1525410, SF#1525423)
- When having multiple tasks with the same subject, new effort records would
  always be created for the first of these tasks instead of the selected task.
  (SF#1513403, SF#1524037)
- Opening a file with a non-ascii filename specified on the command line did
  not work. (SF#1532528)

Features added:
- Japanese translation thanks to Yutaka Usui.
- Filter sidebar.
- Printing. Selecting 'File' -> 'Print' will print the currently active view.
  This means only the visible columns will be printed and only the filtered
  tasks will be printed, in the current sort order. (SF#1481881, SF#1472662,
  SF#1307275, SF#1205819)
- Export to HTML. Selecting 'File' -> 'Export' -> 'Export to HTML' will export
  the currently active view to HTML. This means only the visible columns will
  be exported and only the filtered tasks will be printed, in the current sort
  order. (SF#1375773, SF#1205819)
- Columns with numbers or dates are right-aligned.


Release 0.58 - May 14, 2006

Bugs fixed:
- On Mac OSX, Task Coach would seg fault upon exiting.
- Right-clicking a task in the task tree view would, correctly, pop up the
  context menu, but would not select the underlying task. (SF#1440416)
- The memory leak in the TreeListCtrl was fixed in wxPython 2.6.3.2. The
  installer for Windows and the disk image for Mac OSX use wxPython 2.6.3.2,
  thus fixing the memory leak in Task Coach. If you use the source
  distribution of Task Coach you will have to install wxPython 2.6.3.2
  yourself to get the fix. (SF#1309858)
- Filtering on task categories was improved.
- Hitting Delete when editing the text in the find dialog would delete any
  selected tasks. Unfortunately, to fix this bug some accelerators had to be
  changed: the accelerator for "Delete task" is now Ctrl-Delete, for "New
  task" it is now Ctrl-Insert, and for "New subtask" it is now Shift-Ctrl-
  Insert. (SF#1463316)
- Don't close the current file when user cancels opening another file.
  (SF#1475473)

Features added:
- Added toolbar button for 'new subtask'.
- Task Coach searches incrementally as you type a query in the find bar.
- When dragging a task in the tree view, hover over a tree button (a boxed
  plus-sign or a triangle, depending on your platform) to expand the sub tree.
- To promote a sub task to a top-level task in the tree view, drag it and drop
  it anywhere as long as it is not on another task.
- When filtering tasks by multiple categories, you may either choose to view
  tasks that belong to at least one of the selected categories, or view tasks
  that belong to all selected categories.


Release 0.57 - March 16, 2006

Bugs fixed:
- When adding a new effort to a task, take into account that the user may have
  changed the task that the effort belongs to in the effort editor dialog
  (using the dropdown combobox). Because Task Coach didn't do that, the effort
  would be added twice if the user changed the task of the new effort record.
  (SF#1443906)
- A file that was saved with an active effort couldn't be loaded again. Task
  Coach would complain that the file was invalid. (SF#1433611)
- Added different sizes of the Task Coach icon. This prevents scaling up the
  16x16 version to 32x32 on Windows or to even 128x128 on the Mac.
  (SF#1406651, SF#1434044)

Feature added:
- Task Coach is now also available as disk image (.dmg) for Mac OSX (tested on
  OSX 10.4).


Release 0.56 - February 14, 2006

Features added:
- Tasks can have attachments. Attachments can be added, removed and opened.
  Opening of attachments is done by starting the default application for the
  attachment file type. Attachments can also be dragged from a file browser
  and dropped onto a task in one of the task viewers or on the task
  attachment pane in the task editor dialog. (SF#1250241, SF#1339113)
- Whether a task is marked completed when all its child tasks are completed is
  now a setting that can be changed application-wide via the preferences
  dialog. The application-wide setting can be overruled on a task-by-task
  basis via the task editor dialog. (SF#1393803)
- Task Coach shows a 'tips' dialog at startup. Hopefully it is helpful for new
  users. Experienced users can turn it off.

Features changed:
- More visual feedback when dragging tasks in the tree view.
- Task editor layout changed. Priority is now part of the task description.
  Budget and revenue have been merged into one pane. (SF#1312284)

Implementation changed:
- Default values for task and effort attributes are no longer saved in the
  Task Coach file, resulting in an estimated 33%% reduction of file size.


Release 0.55 - January 13, 2006

Bug fixed:
- Sorting by total budget was broken. (SF#1399116)

Feature added:
- Simple reminders. (SF#1372932)

Dependency changed:
- Task Coach now requires wxPython 2.6.1.0-unicode or newer (this is only
  relevant if you use the source distribution).


Release 0.54 - January 6, 2006

Bugs fixed:
- The accelerators INSERT and Ctrl+INSERT were mapped to 'c' and 'Command-
  Copy' on the Mac, which caused Task Coach to create a new task whenever the
  user typed a 'c'. Fixed by changing the accelerators for new task and new
  subtask to Ctrl+N and Shift+Ctrl+N (on the Mac only). (SF#1311413)
- It was possible to enter control characters -- by copy-and-pasting --
  resulting in invalid XML in the Task Coach file. (SF#1288689)
- One python file was missing in the source distribution of release 0.53.
  Added a test to check that all python files in the source are actually added
  to the source distributions, so hopefully this will never happen again.
  (SF#1389224)

Feature added:
- Effort can be exported as iCalendar (ICS) file and imported into e.g.
  Mozilla Sunbird. Each effort record is exported as a "VEVENT". This is an
  experimental feature. Patch provided by Gissehel.


Release 0.53 - December 19, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- On some platforms, Python and wxPython seem to disagree on what the maximum
  integer is. The maximum integer is used to set the maximum and minimum
  allowed priority values. Fixed by allowing priority values between the
  rather arbitrary minimum and maximum values of -1000000000 and 1000000000.
- Fixed exception: "wx._core.PyAssertionError: C++ assertion "ucf.GotUpdate()"
  failed in ..\..\src\msw extctrl.cpp(813): EM_STREAMIN didn't send
  EN_UPDATE?". This seems to be a bug in wxPython 2.6.0 and 2.6.1. Patch
  provided by Franz Steinhaeusler. (SF#1344023)

Features added:
- Columns in the effort view are hideable too, just like columns in the task
  views. See 'View' -> 'Effort columns', or right-click a column header in the
  effort view.
- Added possibility to mail tasks via your default mailer, see 'Task' ->
  'Mail task' or right-click a task in one of the task views.
- Added option to minimize the window when you attempt to close the
  application via the close button on the window title bar or the system
  menu. See 'Edit' -> 'Preferences' -> 'Window behavior'.


Release 0.52 - November 29, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- For completed tasks, the number of days left for a task is now the number
  of days between the completion date and the due date. This prevents that
  the number of days left of completed tasks keeps decreasing, i.e. becoming
  more negative. For uncompleted tasks, the number of days left is still the
  number of days between today and the due date, of course. Patch provided by
  Maciej Malycha.
- Put taskocachlib package first on the Python search path to prevent name
  conflict with the config module on Gentoo Linux. (SF#1353636)
- Mention blue icon in the help on task colors. (SF#1355985)
- Don't allow empty categories. (SF#1333896)

Features added:
- Tasks can be dragged and dropped. (SF#1262863)
- Tasks can have an hourly fee and/or a fixed fee. Revenue is calculated based
  on effort spent. (SF#1361790)
- First tiny steps towards a user manual, see 'Help' -> 'Help contents'.
- Whether the main window hides itself when iconized is now adjustable
  behavior. See 'Edit' -> 'Preferences'.

Feature changed:
- Backups are created just before saving, instead of when loading a .tsk
  file. Patch provided by Maciej Malycha.

Feature removed:
- Files in the old comma-separated format can no longer be read by Task Coach.


Release 0.51 - October 30, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Hitting enter in the find dialog didn't work on Linux.
- Old TaskCoach.ini files with a language setting of 'en' instead of 'en_US'
  or 'en_GB' would cause an exception. Patch provided by Nirendra Maharaj.

Features added:
- Escape closes pop-up windows. Patch provided by Markus Meyer. (SF#1241547)
- The task of an effort record can be changed.
- Effort records can be cut, copied, and pasted.


Release 0.50 - October 2, 2005

Bug fixed:
- Exception was thrown when opening a task with logged effort.


Release 0.49 - October 2, 2005

Bug fixed:
- Previous release did not work on Linux/Mac OSX because of a platform
  inconsistency between Windows and Linux (GetCountPerPage method is missing
  on Linux, added manually). (SF#1305457)

Feature added:
- Task colors can be adjusted via 'Edit' -> 'Preferences'. (SF#1205579)


Release 0.48 - September 24, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Filtering tasks by status ('View' -> 'Tasks that are' -> '...') would cause
  an exception.
- Sorting by days left would cause an exception. (SF#1295122)


Release 0.47 - September 18, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- 'View'->'All tasks' now also resets any search criterium entered by the user
  in the search bar.
- When opening a task with a (long) description, the cursor will be positioned
  on the first line of the text, instead of on the last line. (SF#1265845)
- When viewing tasks due before a certain date in the tree view, tasks with
  subtasks due before that date will be visible. (SF#1275708)

Features added:
- Added Hungarian translation thanks to Majsa Norbert.
- The task tree view now also shows columns with task details, similar to the
  task list view. (SF#1194642)
- Sorting on task subject can now also be case insensitive. See the menu item
  'View' -> 'Sort' -> 'Sort case sensitive'. (SF#1228873)
- Recent files are remembered and can be opened from the File menu. The
  maximum number of recent files shown can be set in the Preferences dialog.
  Set the maximum to zero to disable this feature. (SF#1191707)
- The last modification time of tasks can be viewed.


Release 0.46 - August 12, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- In the effort views, the status bar would show information about tasks, not
  about effort.
- Entering a negative effort duration while using a non-english language
  would crash Task Coach. (SF#1250177)
- Having a two letter language string (e.g. 'en') in the TaskCoach.ini file
  would cause an error in the preferences dialog. (SF#1247506)

Features added:
- Double-clicking the system tray icon when Task Coach is not minimized will
  raise the Task Coach window. (SF#1242520)
- Added Spanish translation thanks to Juan JosÃ©.

Feature changed:
- Keyboard shortcut for deleting a task is now 'Delete' instead of 'Ctrl-D'
  and 'Ctrl-Enter' marks the selected task(s) completed. (SF#1241549)

Implementations changed:
- Task ids are now persistent, i.e. they are saved to and loaded from the Task
  Coach (XML) file. This will make it easier, in the future, to keep tasks
  synchronized with external sources, e.g. Outlook.
- Task Coach now keeps track of the last modification time of tasks. These
  times are saved to and loaded from the Task Coach (XML) file. This change is
  also in preparation of synchronization functionality.


Release 0.45 - July 26, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- When tracking effort the task file would be marked as changed after every
  clock tick.
- Task priority can now be set to both positive and negative integers.
- Opening a help dialog before the splash screen disappeared would make Task
  Coach stop responding to input. Fixed by making the helpdialogs modeless (as
  they should be). (SF#1241058)

Feature changed:
- Setting the start date of a subtask earlier than the start date of the
  parent task, or setting the due date of a subtask later than the due date of
  the parent task will adapt the parent start or due date as necessary.
  (SF#1237634)


Release 0.44 - July 21, 2005

Feature added:
- Added Russian translation thanks to Valdimir Ilyash.


Release 0.43 - July 19, 2005

Bug fixed:
- Tree and list view were not updated correctly when changing sort key or
  sort order.


Release 0.42 - July 17, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Double clicking a task with children in the tree view would open the edit
  dialog and expand or collapse the task as well. Fixed to not collapse or
  expand the task when double clicking it.
- Adding a subtask to a collapsed parent task now automatically expands the
  parent task.
- Changing the description of a task or effort record wouldn't mark the task
  file as changed.
- Time spent is now updated every second. (SF#1173048)
- Don't try to make a backup when loading the file fails. Reported by Scott
  Schroeder.
- (Windows installer only) Association between .tsk files and Task Coach was
  broken.

Feature changed:
- The start date of a task can now be left unset, creating a task that is
  permanently inactive. This can be useful for activities that you would
  normally not want to plan, but have to keep a time record for, e.g.
  sickness.


Release 0.41 - June 20, 2005

Features added:
- URL's (including mailto) in task and effort descriptions are clickable.
  (SF#1190310)
- Tasks can have a priority. Priorities are integer numbers: the higher the
  number, the higher the priority. Default priority is 0. Negative numbers are
  allowed (SF#1194527, SF#1194567, SF#1210154)

Features changed:
- Default start date of new subtasks is today (used to be the start date of
  the parent task)
- When 'sort by status first' is on, active tasks always come before inactive
  tasks which in turn come before completed tasks, regardless of whether the
  sort order is ascending or descending.


Release 0.40 - June 16, 2005

Bug fixed:
- Budget left was rendered incorrectly when over budget. (SF#1216951)

Feature added:
- Tasks can belong to zero or more categories. Tasks can be viewed/hidden by
  category. (SF#1182172)


Release 0.39 - June 6, 2005

Bug fixed:
- When sorting by due date, composite tasks in the tree view are now sorted
  according to the most urgent subtask instead of the least urgent subtask.

Features added:
- Tasks can be sorted on all attributes (subject, start date, due date,
  budget, etc.) This includes options to sort ascending or descending and to
  first sort by status (active/inactive/completed).
- Sorting order can be changed by clicking on column headers.

Features added:
- Columns in the task list view can be turned on/off by right-clicking on the
  column headers.
- Tasks can be sorted either by due date or alphabetically. (SF#1177984)
- More options when editing an effort record.
- Used a new DatePickerCtrl. (SF#1191909)


Release 0.36 - May 5, 2005

Feature added:
- French user interface added, thanks to Jérôme Laheurte.


Release 0.35 - May 2, 2005

Bugs fixed:

Features added:
- Internationalization support. Task Coach is available with Dutch and English
  user interface. (SF#1164461)
- Added 'expand selected task' and 'collapse selected task' menu items to the
  view menu and the task context menu. (SF#1189978)

- 'Select' -> 'Completed tasks'. This can be done through the View menu too.


Release 0.34 - April 25, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- msvcr71.dll was not shipped with the Windows installer. (SF#1189311)
- Budgets larger than 24 hours were not written correctly to the XML file.
- Mark completed stops effort tracking of parent task. (SF#1186667)

Release 0.31 - April 17, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- A unittest.py bug that was fixed in Python 2.4 revealed a bug in test.py.
  (SF#1181714)
- When searching for a task that is completed, while the 'show completed'
  switch is off, the search shows the path to the task (i.e. parent tasks),
  but not the matched task itself. (SF#1182528)
- When searching for tasks in the tree view, composite tasks are expanded
  automatically to show the children that match the search string.
  (SF#1182528)
- Columns were hidden by setting their width to 0, but that did not make them
  entirely invisible on some Linux platforms. (SF#1152566)
- When editing a subtask, sometimes its branch would be collapsed.
  (SF#1179266)

Features added:
- In the task list and effort list the task column is automatically resized
  to take up the available space.
- Added columns to the task list view for: budget, total budget, budget left,
  and total budget left.
- Reorganized view menu, added extra task filters, added menu item to reset

Bugs fixed:
- New effort in the context menu did not work in release 0.28. (SF#1178562)
- When selecting 'View' -> 'Completed tasks' in the task tree, only completed
  root tasks were hidden. (SF#1179372)

Features added:
- What tab is active is now a persistent setting. This includes the tabs and
  choices in the main window and the effort choices in the task editor.
  (SF#1178779)
- Reordered 'View' -> 'Tasks due before end of' menu. (SF#1178880)
- Added a separate 'Budget' tab in the task editor.
- Taskbar icon now indicates whether task effort tracking is on. (SF#1178057)
- Effort is sorted from most recent to least recent. (SF#1179332)
- Changed task/subtask separator in the task list view from '|' to ' -> '.
  (SF#1179374)


Release 0.28 - April 6, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Hitting return or double click to edit effort in the task editor now works.
  (SF#1172164)
- Subtasks with the same name would only be visible once in the task tree
  view.

Feature added:
- You can hide composite tasks in the task list view so that only leaf tasks
  are visible. Menu item 'View' -> 'Tasks with subtasks'. Requested by Brian
  Crounse.


Release 0.27 - April 4, 2005

Feature added:
- Tasks can have a budget.


Release 0.26 - March 28, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Marking a task completed did not stop effort tracking. (SF#1159918)
- Reading lots of efforts was slow.

Features added:
- Save button is disabled when saving is not necessary, requested by Mike
  Vorozhbensky. (SF#1164472)
- Effort records have a description field, requested by Kent. (SF#1167147)


Release 0.25 - March 13, 2005

Bug fixed:
- The menu item 'Effort' -> 'New effort' did not work in release 0.24.

Features added:
- XML export now includes effort records.
- Effort per day, per week and per month view now also show total time spent
  (i.e. time including time spent on subtasks).


Release 0.24 - March 10, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Saving a selection of tasks to a separate file would also save all effort
  records to that file (instead of just the effort records for the selected
  tasks), giving errors when loading that file.
- Deleting a task with effort records would not delete the effort records.

Feature added:
- The tracking status of tasks is saved. So if you start tracking a task,
  quit Task Coach, and restart Task Coach later, effort for that task is
  still being tracked. Requested by Bob Hossley.


Release 0.23 - February 20, 2005

Bug fixed:
- Fixed a couple of bugs in the unit tests, discovered by Stephen Boulet and
  Jérôme Laheurte on the Linux platform.


Release 0.22 - February 17, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- In the effort summary view, effort spent on a task in the same month or week
  but in different years would erroneously be added. E.g. effort in January
  2004 and January 2006 would be added.
- The mechanism to prevent effort periods with a negative duration (i.e. a
  start time later than the stop time) in the effort editor was invoked on
  each key stroke which caused inconvenient behaviour. Fixed it by only
  invoking it when the user leaves the text or combo box.

Features added:
- Added possibility to start tracking effort for a task, with start time
  equal to the end time of the previous effort period. This is for example
  convenient if you stop working on a task and then spend some time deciding
  on what to do next. This is the 'Start tracking from last stop time' menu
  item in the 'Effort' menu.
- (Re)Added the unittests to the source distribution. See INSTALL.txt.
- Export to XML. Currently limited to tasks, effort is not exported yet.


Release 0.21 - February 9, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Setting the start date/time in the effort editor would change the stop
  date/time while not strictly necessary to prevent negative durations.
- Refreshing the virtual ListCtrl failed under
  wxPython2.5-gtk2-unicode-2.5.3.1-fc2_py2.3 and wxPython-common-
  gtk2-unicode-2.5.3.1-fc2_py2.3. Reported by Stephen Boulet.
- After iconizing the main window for a second time, the icon in the task bar
  wouldn't be hidden anymore. Reported and fixed by Jérôme Laheurte.


Release 0.20 - February 6, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Reading .tsk files version 2 failed.
- Completed child tasks were not hidden in the tree view when 'View->Completed
  tasks' was on.
- Hiding the find panel did not clear the search filter.
- When searching for tasks, not all matches were shown in the tree view.
- Displaying time spent and total time spent in the list view for more than a
  dozen tasks and efforts was slow. Used caching to speed it up.
- Tool tips on the toolbar included mnemonics and accelerator characters on
  Linux. Reported on python-2.3.4 and
  wxPython2.5-gtk2-unicode-2.5.3.1-fc2_py2.3 on Suse 9.2 by Stephen Boulet.

Features added:
- Effort can be viewed summarized per day, per week, and per month.
- Effort for a specific task can be viewed (and edited) in the task editor.
- Effort tracking can be stopped from the taskbar menu.
- Size and position of the main window are saved in the settings and restored
  on the next session. This also includes whether the main window is iconized
  or not.
- Splash screen can be turned off.
